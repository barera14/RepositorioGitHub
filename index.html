                <p>We combine utility, craftsmanship and perfectionism to 
                    create the only desk that gives you absolute freedom in organizing, 
                    upgrading and changing your workspace. With various models of modules 
                    with different functionalities available, you can create a surface that works the best for your needs.

                <h1>Easy to assemble. Rock solid.</h1>
                <p>Modulos surface is comprised of Modules - surface tiles each capable of being
                connected to another one in any direction providing you with infinite possibilities.
                We have refined a super-simple, yet absolutely stable connection system for the modules, 
                which makes assembly a breeze. The only tool you need is a hex key - which is included 
                in your module's box. Simply connect the modules with wooden pins, fasten them together
                 with a simple screw system and you're ready to go! And the desk, of course, holds weight 
                 just as any other desk would!</p>
